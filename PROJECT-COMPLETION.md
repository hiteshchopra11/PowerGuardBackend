# PowerGuard AI Backend Project Completion

## Project Overview
The PowerGuard AI Backend is a sophisticated system designed to optimize battery and data usage on mobile devices through intelligent analysis of device data and user prompts. The system employs natural language processing to understand user needs and provides personalized recommendations to extend battery life and reduce data consumption while ensuring critical apps remain functional.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Smart Prompt Analysis
- **Prompt Classification**: Successfully differentiated between information requests and optimization requests
- **Context Extraction**: Identified critical apps, time constraints, and data constraints from natural language prompts
- **Category Recognition**: Recognized app categories like messaging, navigation, and social media

### 2. Strategy Generation
- **Battery Level Based Strategies**: Implemented different optimization strategies based on battery levels:
  - Critical (0-15%): Very aggressive optimization with maximum savings
  - Low (16-30%): Aggressive optimization with significant savings
  - Moderate (31-50%): Balanced optimization with moderate savings  
  - High (>50%): Minimal optimization with focus on user experience
- **Critical App Protection**: Ensured specified critical apps remained functional during optimization
- **Time Constraint Analysis**: Adjusted strategies to make the battery last for a specified duration
- **Data Constraint Analysis**: Optimized data usage to stay within specified limits

### 3. Actionable Generation
- **App-Specific Actionables**: Created tailored recommendations for individual apps based on usage patterns
- **Global System Actionables**: Generated system-wide settings changes to optimize resource usage
- **Balanced Approach**: Ensured a balanced approach between resource savings and user experience

### 4. Insight Generation
- **Usage Insights**: Provided insights on app usage patterns and resource consumption
- **Savings Estimates**: Generated estimates of expected battery time and data savings
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Created personalized insights based on device state and user needs

### 5. Code Structure and Organization
- **Config Module**: Created configuration files for app categories and optimization strategies
- **Utils Module**: Developed utility modules for strategy analysis, insight generation, and actionable generation
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Created unit tests and integration tests for all components
- **Well-Documented Code**: Added comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Collects device data including battery status, app usage, and memory/CPU usage
