PowerGuard: Problem Analysis & Solution Approach

1. What is the problem being solved? Is it a real need?
Resources—particularly battery and network data—are increasingly costly and precious commodities for mobile users. While Android has built-in systems to optimize battery usage and conserve network data, these solutions follow a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach that fails to account for individual user needs and habits.
We're addressing this fundamental gap by creating a personalized resource management system that:

Leverages AI to make intelligent, user-specific decisions about battery and network optimization based on actual usage patterns as well as past usage history
Provides unprecedented transparency into how resources are being consumed and what specific actions are taken to optimize them
Gives users both granular control over how their device allocates these resources and complete visibility into the decision-making process

Instead of applying blanket restrictions, our solution learns from individual behavior to make smart trade-offs—ensuring messaging apps stay connected during important meetings, conserving data when a user approaches their monthly cap, or optimizing background processes based on a user's daily charging habits.
By combining AI-driven intelligence with user transparency and control, we're creating a resource management system that works with users rather than imposing limitations on them—ultimately extending battery life and reducing data consumption in ways that align with each person's unique needs.

2. Why will the problem be solved better than existing non-AI/non-Agent alternatives?
- Current Limitations of Non-AI Solutions:
  * The BatterySaverPolicy framework in AOSP enforces predefined constraints, applying restrictions only when the battery threshold is reached, rather than dynamically adjusting based on user behavior, which can lead to inefficient resource management.
  * One-size-fits-all approach to network management, ignoring individual usage patterns and needs. This can result in excessive data consumption or insufficient optimization for specific applications.
  * Lack of dynamic network optimization; existing solutions do not adjust data usage based on real-time user behavior, leading to inefficient resource allocation and potential overuse of data plans.
  * Aggressive background app killing can disrupt critical services, particularly for apps that rely on constant connectivity, such as messaging or social media applications. For example, apps like WhatsApp may not be used frequently but are crucial for instant messaging. Default Android behavior categorizes WhatsApp under rarely used apps, which can lead to delayed notifications or background restrictions.
  * Lack of user transparency and straightforward information regarding network usage. Users must manually analyze data settings, which can be cumbersome and lead to uninformed decisions.

- Our AI Solution Advantages:
  * Personalized power and network optimization based on real-time user behavior rather than rigid system-wide rules.
  * Intelligent, adaptive decisions that continuously improve over time, dynamically adjusting battery and network usage as more data is analyzed.
  * Smart resource management, ensuring essential apps remain functional while restricting unnecessary background consumption, striking a balance between performance and efficiency.
  * By leveraging AI, our solution moves beyond static battery and network management and instead delivers a dynamic, user-centric experience that gets smarter over time.
  * Enhanced user transparency and information availability, providing better awareness and control over resource usage. Unlike Android, which requires users to manually analyze data and battery settings, our solution offers straightforward insights, empowering users to make informed decisions.

3. Will the problem be solved better via the specific agent vs just directly using LLMs and prompt engineering?
  * This problem cannot be solved solely by prompt engineering, as it involves many other aspects such as collecting and sending user data, analyzing usage patterns, and taking proactive actions. It requires an end-to-end system that integrates real-time monitoring and response capabilities, which LLMs and prompt engineering alone cannot provide.

4. Is the entire approach unique compared to other agent or non-agent approaches?
  * Yes, the approach is unique compared to other agent or non-agent approaches.

5. How does this approach utilize or reinforce the power of lock screen in solving the problem?
  * The lock screen can serve as a strategic interface for our resource management solution, displaying key resource usage information with complete transparency. By featuring a widget with a single-tap battery/network optimization switch on your lock screen product, users can easily enable resource-saving modes while providing consent for pattern collection. A catchy prompt like "View optimizations" could accompany this switch, redirecting users to our app where they can view their usage patterns, actions taken by our AI, and potential battery and network savings. This approach not only serves users' resource conservation needs but also adds significant value to your lock screen as a glance product, building user trust through utility and transparency while driving deeper engagement.
