# PowerGuard AI Backend Presentation Prompt

Create a professional presentation deck for the PowerGuard AI Backend project with the following sections:

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement (2-3 slides)

- **Opening slide**: Title "PowerGuard AI: Intelligent Battery & Data Optimization"
- **Problem statement**: Mobile device users struggle with battery life and data consumption management:
  - Battery drains unexpectedly during critical moments
  - Data plans get exhausted before end of cycle
  - Users don't know which apps are causing these issues
  - Current optimization solutions are "one-size-fits-all" and don't account for user context or priorities
  - Users need to manually analyze and modify settings for each app

## 2. Solution Overview (2 slides)

- **Value proposition**: An AI-powered backend service that:
  - Analyzes device usage patterns
  - Understands user intent through natural language prompts
  - Generates personalized optimization recommendations
  - Protects critical apps while aggressively optimizing non-essential ones
  - Adapts strategy based on battery level and user constraints

- **Key differentiators**:
  - Natural language understanding of user needs
  - Context-aware optimization with critical app protection
  - Battery level-based adaptation of strategies
  - Time and data constraint handling
  - Information vs. optimization request detection

## 3. Architecture (3-4 slides)

- **System architecture diagram**: Include a visually appealing version of our layered architecture with:
  - User Interface Layer (Android App)
  - API Gateway Layer (FastAPI, Rate Limiting)
  - Processing Layer (Prompt Analysis, Strategy Determination)
  - Generation Layer (Actionable & Insight Generation)
  - Intelligence Layer (Groq LLM)
  - Data Layer (SQLite)

- **Data flow visualization**: Create a simplified, visually engaging diagram showing:
  - How user prompts and device data enter the system
  - The processing stages (prompt analysis, strategy determination)
  - How responses are generated (actionables and insights)
  - The role of LLM integration at each step

- **Smart prompt analysis flow**: Create a visually appealing diagram showing:
  - How prompts are classified (information vs. optimization)
  - Constraint extraction (critical apps, time, data)
  - Strategy determination process
  - Actionable and insight generation

## 4. Key Features (4-5 slides)

- **Natural language prompt understanding**:
  - Show examples of different prompt types and how they're interpreted
  - Include a table of prompt categories (battery, data, combined, time constraints, etc.)
  - Show before/after examples of raw prompts and structured interpretations

- **Battery level-based strategies**:
  - Create a visual diagram showing the four strategy levels:
    * Critical (≤10%): Very aggressive
    * Low (≤30%): Aggressive
    * Moderate (≤50%): Balanced
    * High (>50%): Minimal
  - For each level, show example actions and their impact

- **Critical app protection**:
  - Visualize how the system identifies and protects critical apps
  - Show the categories of apps recognized (messaging, navigation, email, etc.)
  - Include an example of balancing critical app performance with overall optimization

- **Constraint-aware optimization**:
  - Visualize how time constraints are handled ("need battery to last 3 hours")
  - Show how data constraints are processed ("only have 500MB left")
  - Include examples of multi-constraint scenarios

- **Information vs. optimization handling**:
  - Compare information-only responses vs. actionable optimization responses
  - Show how the system generates insights differently for each

## 5. Technical Implementation (2-3 slides)

- **Backend implementation**:
  - FastAPI framework with SQLite database
  - Rate limiting implementation
  - Error handling and logging
  - Security measures

- **AI integration**:
  - Groq LLM integration details
  - Prompt engineering techniques
  - Retry mechanisms and fault tolerance
  - Hybrid approach (rule-based + LLM)

- **Performance metrics**:
  - Response time statistics
  - Throughput capabilities
  - Resource usage metrics

## 6. Demo & Results (2-3 slides)

- **Sample prompts and responses**:
  - Create a slide for each key scenario:
    * Battery optimization
    * Data optimization
    * Critical app protection
    * Time constraint handling
    * Information request

- **Savings metrics**:
  - Visualize potential battery and data savings
  - Show before/after comparisons
  - Include benchmark results

## 7. Usage & Integration (1-2 slides)

- **API usage**:
  - Show sample code for integrating with the API
  - Highlight key endpoints and parameters
  - Include authentication and rate limit considerations

- **Testing tools**:
  - Overview of the testing tools available
  - How to use test endpoints

## 8. Future Enhancements (1 slide)

- **Roadmap items**:
  - Machine learning for personalized optimization
  - Additional app categories
  - Expanded constraint types
  - User feedback integration
  - UI enhancements

## 9. Conclusion (1 slide)

- **Key takeaways**:
  - PowerGuard offers intelligent, context-aware battery and data optimization
  - Natural language understanding allows for personalized user experiences
  - Critical app protection ensures essential functionality remains available
  - Adaptive strategies based on battery level and user constraints
  - Comprehensive API and testing tools for easy integration

## Design Guidelines

- **Visual style**: Modern, clean, and professional
- **Color scheme**: Use a blue and green color palette to represent battery and data
- **Typography**: Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability
- **Diagrams**: Use simplified, visually appealing versions of the architecture diagrams
- **Icons**: Include relevant icons for battery, data, apps, and other key concepts
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent styling throughout the presentation
- **Animations**: Include subtle animations to show data flow and processing steps
- **Image quality**: Ensure all diagrams and images are high resolution
- **Text density**: Keep text concise with bullet points rather than paragraphs
- **Accessibility**: Ensure good contrast and readability

## Example Prompt Scenario Slides

For the demo slides, include these specific examples:

1. **Battery Optimization Example**:
   - Prompt: "Save my battery"
   - Battery level: 15%
   - Show the aggressive strategy applied
   - Include sample actionables and insights
